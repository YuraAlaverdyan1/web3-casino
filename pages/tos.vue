        STAKING
      </li>
      <ul class="mt-[8px] ml-[3px]">
        <li type="a">
          Staking means a process of locking (making temporarily unavailable) of crypto assets at the Protocol through the execution of a smart contract that is usually accompanied by an allocation of reward or provision of privileged access to any specific functionality or provision of any other kind benefits to stakers. Staker is a person who performs staking.
        </li>
        <li type="a">
          We may provide you with the functionality of interacting with supported decentralised protocols for the purpose of staking based on criteria and according to conditions specified by such decentralised protocol. All calculation and distribution of any applicable rewards happen in a complete decentralised fashion through the decentralised protocol operated at the peer-to-protocol model according to the initial parameters set at the moment of creation of such protocol or any related decentralised staking pool (“Staking Pool”).
        </li>
        <li type="a">
          We may create or launch Staking Pools, provided that as soon as they are launched, they will not be operated or controlled by us, rather they will be fully decentralised. We may monitor any Staking Pool in order to determine if you are eligible for any benefits announced by us.
        </li>
        <li type="a">
          You do not interact with us when you perform staking, rather you interact with the corresponding decentralised protocol directly. We do not own or control the underlying software which governs the operation of such decentralised protocol, even technically supported by the Website. We do not and will not be responsible or liable to you for the distribution of any staking rewards. Also, we do not and will not be responsible or liable to you for the provision of any benefits unless specifically promised by us.
        </li>
        <li type="a">
          By performing staking you will be unable to access your staked crypto assets unless you unstake them. In some instances, you may be unable to unstake crypto assets before the specified period of time or the specified event, or such unstaking can incur any additional costs to you and/or loss of staking rewards.
        </li>
        <li type="a">
          You hereby acknowledge and agree that we have no liability to any claims or damages that may arise as a result of your staking and interaction with Staking Pools through the Website.
        </li>
        <li type="a">
          Your staking can be subject to or can incur fees, including fees of decentralised protocols, Staking Pools, transaction fees of blockchains.
